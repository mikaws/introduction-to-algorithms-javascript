# Introduction to Algorithms - Javascript

This repository contains solutions, algorithms and data structures learned throughout the book Introduction to algorithms / Thomas H. Cormen . . . [et al.].â€”3rd ed. All pseudocode implemented in the book was altered by me using Javascript as the major language.

Algorithms not covered by Cormen's book will be in the "others" directory.
